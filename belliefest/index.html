            <p>There is no electricity in the cabins, but it is available in the other buildings at Hostýn. You'll be able to charge your devices during the day if needed.</p>

            <p><b>On food:</b></p>
            <p>We will be providing vegetarian meals and snacks from Friday evening to Sunday morning, with gluten free and vegan options available for those who need. If you have specific dietary restrictions, please let us know and we'll work with you to figure out how to keep you fed.</p>
            <p><b>On gifts:</b></p>
            <p>Over the last 8 years together, we have built a beautiful life and don't need anything more. Your presence and warmth celebrating with us is the only gift we need. If you feel moved to do something more, we would love a family recipe, a shared memory, or a handmade item.</p>
            <p><b>On dress code:</b></p>
            <p>Dress in something that you'd like to be photographed in! We're going to keep it dressy casual for the ceremony. If weather permits, <b>there will be some dancing outside,</b> so make sure your footwear can survive a bit of dirt and grass.</p>
            <p><b>Can I come for just the ceremony?</b></p>
            <p>Of course, kiddo! Come any time before 3:30pm on Saturday to make the ceremony, and leave whenever you get sick of us &#128526</p>
